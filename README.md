# Unhandled Promise Rejection in React Native Data Fetching

This example demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications: unhandled promise rejections during data fetching.  The `DataFetch` component fetches data from an API.  The original code lacks proper error handling, leading to silent failures or crashes if the API request fails.

The solution demonstrates best practices for handling promise rejections and providing a better user experience.
